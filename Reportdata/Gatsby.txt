Gatsby is a tool for creating static websites with React. It allows you to pull your data from virtually anywhere: content management systems (CMSs), Markdown files, APIs, and databases. Gatsby leverages GraphQL and webpack to combine your data and React code to generate static files for your website.

To create a Gatsby site, you’ll need to install the Gatsby CLI. This tool gets you up and running with a Gatsby app in no time. It also runs a development server and builds your Gatsby application for production.

npm install -g gatsby-cli@3.3.0



Create a New Project with Gatsby

Run gatsby new to create an app using Gatsby’s Hello World starter:

gatsby new gatsby-netlify-okta gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
If prompted to choose between yarn and npm, choose npm. This process creates a directory layout, adds a package.json with dependencies, and prints out instructions to continue.

Your new Gatsby site has been successfully bootstrapped. Start developing it by running:

  cd gatsby-netlify-okta
  gatsby develop
  
NOTE: You can also use npm start as an alias for gatsby develop. I use npm start to do the default tasks on most of my Node projects. I love this attention to detail from the Gatsby developers! ❤️

You can use the tree command to view your new project’s directory structure.
