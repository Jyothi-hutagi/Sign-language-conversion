Speech synthesis made easy - Browser based text to speech (TTS)

Installation
npm install speak-tts

Description

Speech synthesis (tts) for the browser. Wrapping the browser Speech Synthesis API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) and providing a similar interface, it improves it by :

-giving a Promise-base API (the init() and speak() methods respectively returns a Promise) -> init() get resolved once voices are loaded -> speak() get resolved once the full text has been spoken

-handling the fact that Chrome load voices in an asynchronous manner when others browsers don't -> onvoiceschanged listener gets triggered in all browsers

-handling some quirks and bugs of IOS/android devices and some chrome/firefox versions
splitting sentences into several speeches to make it sound more natural, especially for older versions of Chrome (can be disabled)

-throwing specific exceptions: explicit exceptions will be thrown if you pass parameters with incompatible values to any of the methods

Usage

Import the library :

import Speech from 'speak-tts' // es6

Check for browser support :

const speech = new Speech() // will throw an exception if not browser supported
if(speech.hasBrowserSupport()) { // returns a boolean
    console.log("speech synthesis supported")
}


Init the speech component :

const speech = new Speech()
speech.init().then((data) => {
    // The "data" object contains the list of available voices and the voice synthesis params
    console.log("Speech is ready, voices are available", data)
}).catch(e => {
    console.error("An error occured while initializing : ", e)
})
